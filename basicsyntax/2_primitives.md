# Primitive data types
Python features a few primitive data types:
* `int`: Unlimited precision, unbounded integers. `1`, `2`, `10`
* `float`: Familiar IEEE-754 floating point numbers. `0.5`, `float('inf')`, `float('nan')`
* `complex`: Complex numbers. `1j`, `-1 + 0j`, `1+1j`, `complex('inf')`
* `bool`: `True` and `False`. Considered a subtype of `int`
* `None`: A singleton to represent the absence of a value
* `str`: A sequence of characters. Both `"` and `'` may be used, as long as they are consistent. Python makes no distinction between a `chr` and a `str`
